While paraphrased, this quote's always stuck with me. It's painfully obvious, but paying heed to the advice of people who have walked the path you want to walk is wise. Applied more broadly, this can be truly profound. It applies in more conventional cases, but it can also be applied as an exponential multiplier on your growth.

There's no incentive for people to give you adviceâ€”when people you know give you advice, it's almost always with your best interest in mind. I wanted to use this article as a chance to compile some of my favorite nuggets of wisdom I've received over the years. 

It's years since I've originally heard some of these, so you'll have to forgive me if the quotes aren't transcribed with 100% accuracy.

> But, as an addendum, in the context of America I think that this wisdom hurt me, not helped me. In China, the nail that sticks out gets hammered in, but in the context of the US, individualism is rewarded and one must advocate for themself.

> You may think you're smarter than me, or your classmates, but remember, the you of tomorrow will be smarter than the you of today.

> When I was a new grad, I focused on the entirely wrong thing. I joined a team full of senior and staff engineersâ€”in an effort to prove myself I focused on closing tickets as quickly as possible, but I think I approached it in the wrong way. A lot the growth you go through is in the process, diving deep and slowly gaining knowledge is how you become a great engineer.
