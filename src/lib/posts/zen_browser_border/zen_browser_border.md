title: how to remove the zen browser border
---
I'll be quick.

Here's how:

```
1. Navigate to `about:config` in the Zen Browser
2. Set `zen.theme.border-radius` to `0`
3. Set `zen.theme.content-element-separation` to `0`
```

Done!

I'm that guy that constantly switches browsers and I've been loving the Zen Browser, it has all the niceties of Arc (or at least the ones that I use) with the security and privacy ([Arc...](https://kibty.town/blog/arc/)) that the Firefox engine brings ([although recently...](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-51/)).
