title: code and storytelling

In the past month, I've graduated from UCSB (still procrastinating on that blog post) and started a new job as a Software Engineer at Windsurf (I could say lots about how much I like it here so far but I'll opt to save it for another time). And as someone new, my job recently has mostly been comprised of reading and understanding code — **lot's** of code. To be frank, I love it.

When you're a beginner writing code, you may wrestle with the compiler, futilely believing that it **must** be wrong. Yet once you take a closer look, you find the tiny error you had made. Repeat this experience a hundred times and you realize that every single machine around you behaves how it does because someone told it to do so. 

Life is very, very complicated. Most things don't have an answer or a truth, but that's what makes software beautiful. It does have a singular truth, and you as a programmer have access to it. These intricate and complicated systems around you all have a detailed manual you can read, understand, and add to. With just a few keystrokes you can change the behavior of these behemoths. 

Beyond the sentimental value, I love the action of reading code. Darting around going to definitions and references, searching for the parts of code I want to read using Cascade (this really does feel like magic), and slowly getting a grasp of what exactly is going on by making hypotheses and verifying your understanding.

As you spend more and more time in a codebase you slowly build a picture of not just the style and patterns used in the code, but you begin to see and infer things more broadly. What engineer owns this feature? For what purpose was this written? Were there deadlines causing more hacks to be written in this part? As I dive into random PRs through git blames, read more of the conversations occurring, or look at some funny commit messages — layers build up like sediment to form the mountain that is the codebase.

I'm someone who's always loved reading. I remember every night before bed I'd crack open a book and read it until my eyes got blurry. During those moments, it felt like the world around me faded away, and I was fully immersed in the world of the story. Reading code evokes that same sense of curiosity and exploration in me, and I hope that never changes.
