My good friend [Tanay](https://tanaybiradar.com/) came to me with an interesting proposition, a series of questions he asked himself and sat down to answer.

Below are my answers to my self interrogation.

## wheel of life

_What are you in each of these categories (out of 10)? How could you improve?_

- Health

  - mind (7/10) - I could read more and be more intentional with curating a quiet environment for my thoughts, in addition I could always work on my patience and calmness.
  - body (3/10) - This needs a lot of work. My immune system hasn't been great all my life and haven't been taking enough care of my body.
  - soul (8/10) - I have been feeling generally fulfilled with my life and work, there are always rough spots and I could get better and dealing with those.

- Relationships

  - friends (6/10) - I have some great, close friends but should spend more effort to spend time with them as well as meet new people.
  - romance (9/10) - My relationship is awesome but I could always improve as a partner (communicating, being thoughtful, patience).
  - family (5/10) - Partly due to distance, partly due to my lack of intentionality, I haven't been a great son / brother. I should reach out and call more.

- Work
  - growth (10/10) - My growth professionally has been objectively tremendous in these last two years entering college. I could improve my being more intentional in the time I spend learning, focused and in bursts rather than drawn out and lackadaisical as I have often been.
  - money (9/10) - I am / will be in a good position financially (strong income, no debt), but don't rate this a perfect 10 as I could've started investing earlier and there are always people making more. Improvement will come from smart and prudent long term financial planning and career advancement.
  - mission (10/10) - I believe that building something that lets people build more is an incredibly important mission.

## finding a path

_Where am I now?_ I'm on my bed writing this blog post on Obsidian. Perhaps more in the spirit of the question, broadly, I'm about to graduate college and begin my life as an adult.

_Where do I want to be?_ Short term? Shoving my head into my craft with work that invigorates me. Long term? Happy, healthy, and surrounded with people who I love and love me.

_How do I get there?_ Short term: Improve my skills a little bit every day however much I can. Long term: Haven't quite figured this one out yet, but I believe persistent effort in improving my life state is a good first step.

## story of fulfillment

_Think (write) about a time in your life when you did something well & it brought you fulfillment._

> I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free
>
> -- **Michelangelo**

To compare me to Michelangelo is to compare a headless chicken to a T. Rex, but despite the thousands of years separating us his words still resonate. Like the marble, I can see the finished product in my scrambled thoughts, but for me to free then angel I have to sit down and put the pen to paper (or digital characters into text document).

There is something irrevocable when your ethereal thoughts become a tangible reality. The reader may learn a little bit about the writer, but the writer will learn tenfold that about themself. Although maybe not well, when I write I feel deeply fulfilled.

## dream work

_If you could do anything right now, what would it be? What if money wasn't an issue? What if what people thought wasn't an issue? What would you try/learn/experiment/etc. if you know you can't fail? or even if you knew you would fail?_

If I could do anything right now I'd be writing software. Even if money wasn't an issue, regardless of what people think, even if I knew I wouldn't fail, and even if I knew I'd fail.

I always harp on this story, but I was inspired to go into software engineering because I read Walter Isaacson's book _The Innovators_. I was and still am amazed at the amount a single individual can affect people's lives through software.

Recently I watched an interview of [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQnz7L6x068&t=3151s) (of Hashicorp and Ghostty fame) where he discusses his love of work and code; describing his open source work as a form of technical philanthropy. Given financial freedom I'd like to imagine I would so something similar.

## eulogy

_When I die, what eulogy do I want?_

I want my eulogy to be filled with warm and personal accounts by the people I was closest to while alive. Goofy one off stories, spontaneous adventures, and the little bits and pieces that make me the person I am.

This is actually a question that's lived in my mind for quite a while, even having written about it extensively in an essay for high school. In high school I wrote about how I wanted to be remembered as "great", but both me and my views have changed over time.

I believe that someone lives not just as a person in their own mind, but as a million versions of themselves in others. To me, if I can still be remembered vividly and warmly by the people who I was closest to, I would be more alive than dead.

## ideal tuesday

_What's an ideal Tuesday 5 years from now?_

**Morning:** Rise early and make a hearty breakfast before waking up my girlfriend, feed the pets, and head off to work.

**Work:** Say hi to my work buddies before getting a nice whole day of deep uninterrupted work in the flow state. Finish up a tricky problem I'd been stuck on for weeks and recline my chair with my arms behind my head.

**Evening:** Come home tired, but fulfilled. Make dinner for me and my partner and watch a few episodes of our show on the couch with our pets. Shower, wind down, and read in bed for a few hours before going to sleep.
