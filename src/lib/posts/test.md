Neovim is a highly customizable and extensible text editor that has become popular among developers. Here's a quick tip for new users:

To install a plugin manager like [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), run the following in your terminal:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
