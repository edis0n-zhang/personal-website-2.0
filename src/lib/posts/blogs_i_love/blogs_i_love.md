## Why Blogs?

In a world where everyone's online presence feels flat and the same on social media, blogs are a place where people really express themselves. Away from all the noise, in a quiet little corner, people take turns on their little soap boxes sharing their innermost (shareable) thoughts. There's no incentive to chase views, no monetary benefit, and no platform to advertise â€” blogs are a direct channel into someone else's life and their lived experience.

## Some of my Favorites

Enough blabbering, here's some of my favorite blogs! Linked will be my favorite post I've read from them.

**Last updated:** 10/15/24

**[Tanay Biradar](https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/personal-growth-and-sgd/)**: Tanay is a microceleb at UCSB, my good friend, and a great blogger! He writes about his ML papers, research, and musings on life. Lots posts we write are just from chats we have!

**[Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/design-is-compromise)**: Steph posts snippets of thought on design and software. His writing has had a great influence on my thoughts on design and what it should and shouldn't be. Not linked here, but I also love his [40 questions to ask yourself every decade](https://stephango.com/40-questions-decade), went through it with Tanay and really loved the process.

**[Johnny Rodgers](https://johnnyrodgers.is/The-death-of-Glitch-the-birth-of-Slack)**: Johnny writes about the process of building software and reflections on life. Love reading about his thoughts on engineering and the journey of being a human.

**[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest)**: Maggie writes in depth and thought provoking pieces but in a playful manner. Filled with illustrations and personal quirks, her site is always an awesome visit. I hope I can write in a way that is half as enjoyable to read.

**[Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/the-fools-who-dream)**: Jacky writes about the self, AI, and the online you. Reading his writing was a great inspiration to myself, and my original blog was built off of his project [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)!
