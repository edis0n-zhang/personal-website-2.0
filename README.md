# personal-website-2.0

taken from my article titled [README.md](https://www.edisonzhang.dev/writing/README).

## tech

This site is built using Svelte (my frontend framework of choice), Tailwind CSS, and Mdsvex.

Blog posts are .md files with a tiny bit of Svelte sprinkled in, stored in `posts/[article_title]/` with its accompanying images and assets (this file is actually funnily titled README.md.md).

I edit my posts in Obsidian by creating a [symbolic link](https://www.howtogeek.com/297721/how-to-create-and-use-symbolic-links-aka-symlinks-on-a-mac/) from my cloned repo to my Obsidian vault.

Feel free to use and modify my website as you wish. All of its source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/edis0n-zhang/personal-website-2.0).

Glad we got the boring stuff out of the way, now for me to ramble on why I built this the way its built.

## philosophy, stuff, and digital me

Last year was my first time hosting my personal website. I'm glad I did!

At the time I was far less familiar with building and deploying stuff on the web and was (and still am) hopelessly obsessed with Obsidian. I was waiting for a flight home from North Carolina and stumbled across [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a fantastic and free way to host your Obsidian online.

I had lots of fun posting on it and it's a great tool if you want to host docs or markdown online -- but what I wanted was a bit more personal and I felt that my Quartz no longer reflected who I was.

I built this site to serve as a digital representation of me. Fun little quirks like a lightbulb you can actually pull (haha Thomas Edison pun!), nice rounded designs, a steph ango inspired color scheme, and a typo in the typewriter of the logo, the little design decisions that are a better reflection of me today.

I made a lot of design decisions out of more personal than practical reasons. No UI library, not even my beloved shadcn, minimal guides, and no templates are all made more because "I kinda want to try that" rather than "I think this is the best way to build it."

I'm sure there's a better way to animate a lightbulb; but my janky CSS implementation is one I like more.

Another thing I wrestle with about my personal sites is, _just how much do I share?_ I'm not a very outspoken person, so it's hard for me to balance the desire to make a post and share it versus the urge to make something and hide it.

My solution was no mailing list, no rss feed, no analytics -- just a webpage. You'll never find me on here talking about anything except what I want to talk about and when. One day you might get a summary of an ML paper I found interesting, on another you might find a detailed breakdown on a niche team structure in the Pokemon Showdown OU ladder I find intriguing.

I loved building this website and I hope that these decisions will help my site be a better reflection of who I am today (and make me write more...), I hope I see you around!
